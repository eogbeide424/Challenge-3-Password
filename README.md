## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site]: 

On this particular project we had to create a random password generator these are a few code lines I used to somewhat achieved it.
## Code Snippet
< // pick your characters confirm window
  function charTypes() {
     lower = confirm("use lowercase characters?");
     upper= confirm('Use uppercase characters?');
     num= confirm('include numbers?');
     symbol= confirm('include special characters?');
     return{lower,upper,num,symbol};
  }

## Troubles I faced
Alot of trouble I ran into one in particular is not knowing I would need empty variables to push the password to I realize in this project I hadn't quite done that and I probably might fail but this deep dive into objects and if else statements proved I have a long way to go but I came further than what I thought I could.

## Code Snippett

offPass = "";
    if (charType.lower) offPass+= userPass.lowerCase.join("");
    if (charType.upper) offPass+= userPass.upperCase.join("");
    if (charType.num) offPass+= userPass.numArr.join("");
    if (charType.symbol) offPass+= userPass.symbolArr.join("");

    var password = [""];
    for(var i =0; i=userPass.passLength;i++) {
      var index =Math.floor(Math.random()* offPass.length);
      index.password = password;
    }
If I had more time I probbably would of figured this one out but time is dwindling to turn it in I'm going to keep working on this until I get it.
